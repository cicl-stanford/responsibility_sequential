1814,condition 1,59,2,3,,The experiment is not at all realistic. The way it allows a human to permit the AI to go in a direction with a road closure that the human knows about is the same as saying the human will knowingly chose a route with a known closure. ,Male,White,3658154,

If the AI drove and hit a road block that the driver should have known, then I blamed the driver more especially leaving AI to drive. But if driver chose to  continue driving with no road blocks then driver more at fault. I forget whatever condition there was. Definitely with a car accident, neither can be blamed. My ratings may not be consistent, as I was still settling on criteria for who was more to blame.

1761,condition 1,43,1,1,Non-Hispanic,It was hard to decide. If there was traffic the driver kind of new the spots so they should given themselves more time so although they didn't cause the traffic they were kind of responsible. An accident is unpredictable,Male,White,935650,
